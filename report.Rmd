## Correlation between significant events and prison population of England and Wales

We have selected some worldwide events to see whether if they show any noticeable correlation with changes in the prison population of England and Wales.[^origin]

## Prime Minister
For the Prime Minister section, we analyzed the full data set across all years to compare crime trends before and during each Prime Minister's term. However, limitations included difficulty in directly linking changes to specific policies, leading to some assumptions. To address this, we examined different crime types and related policies.

We then looked into key issues and possible related government responses for both Lord Cameron and Theresa May.

### Lord Cameron(2010-2016):

#### 1.Drug Offences

Trend: 
Significant decline after 2010

Key Issues:

- Shift from punitive measures to rehabilitation and tackling high-level trafficking.

Government Response:

- Expanded funding for drug treatment and harm reduction initiatives.

#### 2.Fraud Offences

Trend: 
Declined, reflecting a transition to cyber fraud.

Key Issues:

- Limited resources allocated for investigating complex fraud and increasing online scams

Government Response:

- Strengthened cybercrime units and encouraged private sector involvement in fraud prevention. 

#### 3.Rape

Trend: 
Reports and imprisonments steadily increased.

Key Issues:

- Greater awareness and public demand for action

Government Response:

- Funded support services and introduced training for handling rape cases.


#### 4.Robbery

Trend: 
Peaked early, then declined significantly

Key Issues:

- Economic recession initially drove rates up, while urban safety measures later reduced offenses.

Government Response:

- Promoted urban safety initiatives like CCTV and improved penalties for violent robbery.


#### 5.Theft Offences 

Trend: 
Declined after an intial rise.

Key Issues:

- Technological advancements in security deterred theft.

Government Response:

- Supported public safety campaigns and neighbourhood watch programs.


### Theresa May(2016-2019):

#### 1.Drug Offences

Trend:
Fluctuated, with a rise linked to county lines operations.

Key Issues:

- Vulnerable individuals exploited by organized crime.

Government Response:

- Strengthened the National Crime Agency (NCA) and introduced targeted interventions.


#### 2.Fraud Offenses

Trend: 
Continue declined due to a shift towards cyber fraud. 

Key Issues:

- Limited resources for complex fraud investigations.

Government Response:

- Promoted private sector collaboration and expanded cybercrime units.


#### 3.Rape

Trend: 
Reports rose sharply, reflecting increased awareness

Key Issues:

- Persistent gaps in convictions despite higher reporting.

Government Response:

- Improved victim support and police training for sensitive cases.

#### 4.Robbery

Trend: 
Steep decline due to improved surveillance and urban safety measures.

Key Issues:

- Economic challenges and reduced police presence.

Government Response:

- Strengthened penalties and promoted urbvan safety programs.


#### 5.Theft Offences

Trend: 
Consistently declined due to imporved security measures.

Key Issues:

- Shift from physical theft to online fraud

Government Response:

- Supported neighborhood watch programs and public awareness campaigns. 


## The effect of COVID-19 on prison population of different custody types
*Sky and Maggie*

We analysed the rate of change in the prisoner population, `d1_Count`, over time, using different subsets of custody type.

### Methods

We created an indicator variable `lockdown_happens` which takes the value of 1 during the first lockdown period (2020 March 26 to July 4) [^covid_date1][^covid_date2], and 0 at any other given time. This will be used as an explanatory variable for our model.

We used linear regression for our models, the response variable being the rate of change of prisoner population `d1_Count`, and the explanatory variables being `lockdown_happens` and `Date`. `Date` is included to test whether there was a trend with respect to time in `d1_Count`.

The reason we chose these variables for the following reasons. From preliminary assessment of the data through graphs, we saw that although `d1_Count` is unstable, it oscillates roughly around 0 throughout time, and in some cases like Extended determinate sentences, there appeared to be a decreasing trend with respect to time.



1. **Model 1 (custody_fit_yesInt)**: This model included the variables `Date`, `lockdown_happens`, and the interaction between these two variables (`Date * lockdown_happens`). This model assesses how the lockdown period affected the population change in sentenced custody over time while accounting for any general time trend.

2. **Model 2 (custody_fit_noInt)**: This model is did not include interaction term and only considers the effects of `Date` and `lockdown_happens`.

3. **Model 3 (custody_fit_Simple)**: The simplest model of the three, which only uses `lockdown_happens` as a predictor.

### Results

#### Subset "adult sentenced"
This subset showed the strongest reponse to the specified lockdown dates.

**Model 1 `(custody_fit_yesInt)`** The all estimated coefficients are statistically insignificant (p-values > 0.7), suggesting that this model is invalid. $\bar{R}^2 = 0.166$ (adjusted $R^2$) , it is the lowest among the models we used.

**Model 2 `(custody_fit_noInt)`** Without the interaction effect, `lockdown_happens` has a negative estimated coefficient of $-600 \pm 100$ (SE), while `Date`â€™s coefficient is insignificant (p = 0.702). $\bar{R}^2 = 0.170$.

**Model 3 `(custody_fit_Simple)`** With the only explanatory variable being `lockdown_happens`, it's estimated coefficient is $-600 \pm 100$ (SE), similar to Model 2. This suggests that during the period of lockdown, the rate of change of prison population for the selected subset is about 600 less than during normal times. It has the highest adjusted R-squared (0.1734), suggesting that `lockdown_happens` is the key factor of variance in d1_Count without additional predictors or interactions. $\bar{R}^2 = 0.173$, the highest among the models used.

#### Other subsets
Other subsets showed different responses to COVID:

| Subset chosen | $\bar{R}^2_{yesInt}$ | $\bar{R}^2_{noInt}$ | $\bar{R}^2_{simple}$  | `lockdown_happens` coefficient in `(custody_fit_Simple)` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sentenced | 0.166 |  0.170  |  0.173  | $600 \pm 100$ |
| Remand | 0.0998  | 0.0777  | 0.0249  | $140 \pm 60$ |
|  Length not recorded |  0.00459 | -0.00426  | 0.000854 | $-20 \pm 10$ |  |

Remand showed a positive correlation with lockdown (it was negative for Sentenced), and Length not recorded did not show any noticeable response.

### Interpretation

Applying Occam's Razor, the simplest model that still provides meaningful explanatory power should be used. Our result suggests time (i.e. `Date`) has no significant correlation with change in adult sentenced prisoners, and lockdown in UK has a correlation with the decrease in population.
   
The relatively low $\bar{R}^2$ values across all models is expected, since all sorts of external factors and the inaccuracies of our model can influence the results. Our linear model is simplistic in nature, and `lockdown_happens` is only based on dates that might not accurately reflect prisoner flux dynamics (i.e. did lockdown itself caused the change in prison population, or COVID-19 itself, some other factors, or a combination of everything?).
