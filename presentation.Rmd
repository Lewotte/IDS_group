#Correlation Between Significant Events and Prison Population of England and Wales

---
class: inverse, left, middle

## A look at the effect of COVID-19 on prison population

We explored the effect of lockdown measures in UK on the prison population.

Data we looked at is grouped by Custody type:
1. Sentenced (supergroup of all length-determined sentences, e.g. 7-10 yrs)
  - This group contains miscellaneous subgroups such as "Sentence length not recorded".
2. Remand (i.e. pre-trial detention)
3. Non-criminal prisoners (civil offenders)

And is sorted by gender (Male & Female). Most prisoners are male.

## Important dates used for modeling

- First lockdown enforced: $^1$
  - March 26, 2020
- Most lockdown restrictions lifted (until start of 2nd lockdown): $^2$
  - July 4, 2020
- All lockdown restrictions lifted for the last time: $^3$
  - June 19, 2021

#PRIME MINISTERS

#####Theresa May is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from July 2016 to July 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, she was the second woman to hold the office of Prime Minister, after Margaret Thatcher.

```{R Hanna_Vivi graph,echo = FALSE}

```
---
###1. Violence Against The Person
####Trend: Violent crime, including domestic violence, increased during Theresa May's time as Prime Minister. Austerity measures reduced police resources, but awareness campaigns led to more reporting of such crimes.
####Key Issues:
- Rising arrests for violent crimes raised concerns about public safety.
- Domestic violence and knife crime were particularly alarming during her leadership.

####Factors:
Increased Reporting: Campaigns encouraged victims to come forward.
Austerity: Budget cuts reduced the number of police officers.
Social Media: Highlighted incidents and raised public awareness.

####Government Response:
- Introduced the Serious Violence Strategy to tackle knife crime and gang violence.
- Focused on addressing domestic violence with funding for shelters and new laws.

---
###2. Burglary 
####Trend: Burglary rates declined during Theresa May’s tenure, partly due to improved home security systems. However, police budget cuts under austerity raised concerns about reduced capacity to address these crimes.
####Key Issues :
- Decline in arrests may reflect reduced police resources rather than fewer burglaries.
- Continued reliance on homeowners to secure their properties.

####Factors :
- Better Security: Increased use of CCTV, alarms, and smart locks deterred burglars.
- Austerity: Police funding cuts led to fewer officers investigating burglaries.
- Criminal Shift: Some offenders moved toward cybercrime instead of traditional burglary.

####Government Response :
- Promoted neighborhood watch programs and public campaigns on home security.
- Focused police efforts on higher-priority crimes, leaving burglary less emphasized.

---
###3. Fraud and Forgery
####Trend: Fraud increasingly shifted online during May’s tenure, with cybercrime emerging as a dominant concern. Traditional forgery and fraud arrests declined as enforcement adapted to these changes.
####Key Issues:
- Cybercrime posed new challenges for law enforcement, requiring specialized skills and resources.

####Factors:
- Technological Shift: Rapid digitization created opportunities for online fraud.
- Public Awareness: Many individuals and businesses lacked awareness of cybersecurity risks.
- Resource Limitations: Austerity limited the expansion of specialized cybercrime units.

####Government Response:
- Expanded the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime capabilities.
- Promoted public education campaigns to raise awareness of online fraud risks.

---
###4. Drug Offences
####Trend: Drug-related crime remained a persistent issue during May’s tenure, with a focus on tackling organized crime networks and trafficking rather than low-level offenses.
####Key Issues:
- A fluctuating trend in drug-related arrests reflected changing enforcement strategies.
- Rising concern over county lines drug operations involving vulnerable individuals.


####Factors:
- Organized Crime: Increased trafficking and exploitation of minors in drug distribution.
- Reduced Policing Capacity: Austerity limited proactive drug enforcement efforts.
- Changing Social Attitudes: Shifts in societal views on recreational drug use affected enforcement priorities.

####Government Response:
- Strengthened the role of the National Crime Agency (NCA) in combating drug trafficking.
- Launched initiatives to address county lines drug operations, including safeguarding vulnerable individuals.

---
###5. Rape
####Trend:Sexual violence reporting increased during May’s tenure due to heightened awareness and improved survivor support systems. However, there was criticism about the low prosecution rates for these crimes.
####Key Issues:
- Rising arrests reflected improved reporting but also revealed gaps in handling sexual violence cases.

####Factors:
- Social Movements: Global campaigns like #MeToo increased awareness and reporting of sexual violence.
- Police Training: Law enforcement became better equipped to handle sensitive cases.
- Judicial Backlogs: Delays in prosecution and low conviction rates caused frustration among victims

####Government Reponse:
- Promoted better police training on handling sexual offenses.
- Advocated for increased funding for victim support programs and rape crisis centers.
- Supported the creation of specialist units to handle sexual violence cases.

---
###6. Robbery
####Trend:Fluctuations in robbery arrests reflected targeted interventions in high-crime areas, though austerity measures hindered broader prevention efforts.
####Key Issues:
- Robbery remained a concern, especially in urban areas with higher youth crime rates.

####Factors:
- Youth Involvement: Economic challenges during austerity may have driven some young people toward robbery.
- Targeted Policing: Police focused resources on areas with high robbery rates.
- Technological Advances: Improved surveillance helped deter robberies.

####Government Response:
- Promoted community engagement programs to prevent youth involvement in robbery.
- Supported the use of data-driven policing to identify and target robbery hotspots.


---
###7. Other Offenses
####Trend:An increase in arrests for miscellaneous crimes, such as public order offenses and emerging cyber-related crimes, highlighted changing priorities in law enforcement under May’s leadership.

####Key Issues:
- Law enforcement struggled to address modern challenges with reduced resources.

####Factors:
- Emerging Crimes: Growth in cyber-related offenses and technology-driven crimes.
- Shifting Social Norms: Changes in public behavior led to new categories of offenses.

####Government Response:
- Modernized police training to address evolving threats, such as cybercrime and organized crime.
- Introduced the Modern Slavery Act 2015, targeting exploitation and human trafficking.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
