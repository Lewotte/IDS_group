## A look at the effect of COVID-19 on prison population of different custody types

---

## Custody types

We explored the effect of lockdown measures in UK on the prison population.

--

Data we looked at is grouped by Custody type:
1. Sentenced (supergroup of all length-determined sentences, e.g. 7-10 yrs). This group contains miscellaneous subgroups such as "Sentence length not recorded".

--

2. Remand (i.e. pre-trial detention)

--

3. Non-criminal prisoners (civil offenders)

--

And everything is sorted by gender (Male &amp; Female).
---

## Important dates used for modeling

- First lockdown enforced: `\(^1\)` March 26, 2020

- Most lockdown restrictions lifted (until start of 2nd lockdown): `\(^2\)` July 4, 2020

--

- All lockdown restrictions lifted for the last time: `\(^3\)` June 19, 2021

---

## Important dates used for modeling

(insert plot of sentenced, adult, male &amp; female separate, with annotation)

---

## How is the data modelled?

We first produced the rate of change of prisoner population using the `diff {base}` function:

``` r
d1_Count = diff(c(0,Count))
```

--

We created a binary variable `lockdown_happens` where the value of it is 0 for all date entries when UK was not under lock-down, and 1 when it is.

``` r
lockdown_happens = ifelse(Date &lt; ymd("2020-03-26") | Date &gt; ymd("2021-06-19"), 0, 1)
```

--


```

## The model

**Response Variable**: the rate of change of prisoner population, `d1_Count`.

**Explainatory variables:** `lockdown_happens` and `Date` .

--

We made three simple linear models:


``` r
custody_fit_yesInt &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%
  set_engine("lm") %&gt;%
  fit(&lt;...&gt;, data = Custody_modeling)
  ...
```

- `d1_Count ~ Date + lockdown_happens + Date * lockdown_happens`
This takes into consideration of both explanatory variables and their interaction effect.

--

- `d1_Count ~ Date + lockdown_happens`
This takes into consideration of both explanatory variables without interaction effect.

--

- `d1_Count ~ lockdown_happens`
This takes into consideration of just the lockdown indicator variable.

#PRIME MINISTERS - Theresa May

#####Theresa May is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from July 2016 to July 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, she was the second woman to hold the office of Prime Minister, after Margaret Thatcher.

&lt;img src="img/Primeminister.png" width="80%" /&gt;
---
###1. Violence Against The Person
####Trend: Violent crime, including domestic violence, increased during Theresa May's time as Prime Minister. Austerity measures reduced police resources, but awareness campaigns led to more reporting of such crimes.
####Key Issues:
- Rising arrests for violent crimes raised concerns about public safety.
- Domestic violence and knife crime were particularly alarming during her leadership.

####Factors:
Increased Reporting: Campaigns encouraged victims to come forward.
Austerity: Budget cuts reduced the number of police officers.
Social Media: Highlighted incidents and raised public awareness.

####Government Response:
- Introduced the Serious Violence Strategy to tackle knife crime and gang violence.
- Focused on addressing domestic violence with funding for shelters and new laws.

---
###2. Burglary 
####Trend: Burglary rates declined during Theresa Mayâ€™s tenure, partly due to improved home security systems. However, police budget cuts under austerity raised concerns about reduced capacity to address these crimes.
####Key Issues :
- Decline in arrests may reflect reduced police resources rather than fewer burglaries.
- Continued reliance on homeowners to secure their properties.

####Factors :
- Better Security: Increased use of CCTV, alarms, and smart locks deterred burglars.
- Austerity: Police funding cuts led to fewer officers investigating burglaries.
- Criminal Shift: Some offenders moved toward cybercrime instead of traditional burglary.

####Government Response :
- Promoted neighborhood watch programs and public campaigns on home security.
- Focused police efforts on higher-priority crimes, leaving burglary less emphasized.

---
###3. Fraud and Forgery
####Trend: Fraud increasingly shifted online during Mayâ€™s tenure, with cybercrime emerging as a dominant concern. Traditional forgery and fraud arrests declined as enforcement adapted to these changes.
####Key Issues:
- Cybercrime posed new challenges for law enforcement, requiring specialized skills and resources.

####Factors:
- Technological Shift: Rapid digitization created opportunities for online fraud.
- Public Awareness: Many individuals and businesses lacked awareness of cybersecurity risks.
- Resource Limitations: Austerity limited the expansion of specialized cybercrime units.

####Government Response:
- Expanded the National Crime Agencyâ€™s cybercrime capabilities.
- Promoted public education campaigns to raise awareness of online fraud risks.

---
###4. Drug Offences
####Trend: Drug-related crime remained a persistent issue during Mayâ€™s tenure, with a focus on tackling organized crime networks and trafficking rather than low-level offenses.
####Key Issues:
- A fluctuating trend in drug-related arrests reflected changing enforcement strategies.
- Rising concern over county lines drug operations involving vulnerable individuals.


####Factors:
- Organized Crime: Increased trafficking and exploitation of minors in drug distribution.
- Reduced Policing Capacity: Austerity limited proactive drug enforcement efforts.
- Changing Social Attitudes: Shifts in societal views on recreational drug use affected enforcement priorities.

####Government Response:
- Strengthened the role of the National Crime Agency (NCA) in combating drug trafficking.
- Launched initiatives to address county lines drug operations, including safeguarding vulnerable individuals.

---
###5. Rape
####Trend:Sexual violence reporting increased during Mayâ€™s tenure due to heightened awareness and improved survivor support systems. However, there was criticism about the low prosecution rates for these crimes.
####Key Issues:
- Rising arrests reflected improved reporting but also revealed gaps in handling sexual violence cases.

####Factors:
- Social Movements: Global campaigns like #MeToo increased awareness and reporting of sexual violence.
- Police Training: Law enforcement became better equipped to handle sensitive cases.
- Judicial Backlogs: Delays in prosecution and low conviction rates caused frustration among victims

####Government Reponse:
